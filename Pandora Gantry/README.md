These are .3MF files that contain modified Pandora's Box and Pandora Gantry for use with a Box-Zero format printer. 

Things to note. Files are .3MF because exporting them as .STL doesn't keep the negative space objects (or I'm just doing it wrong). 
Do not repair the files. For whatever reason with some of the files get repaired they don't print the interposed objects as a single part.
